# Project 1 - Created by Chris Ricchi

## Description

In the project 1 folder, you will find subdirectories of all of the submitted work for our Applied Statistics class listed in numerical order. I built the full project in this format for ease of access, convenience, and to provide a simple interpretation of all of the submitted work, data, and results. Project 1 goes over all instructed topics, starting with basic Excel formatting and histogram creation, spanning through all covered topics up to the final implementation of our Stats Library java program.
